# Thoughts about teaching programming to CHM students

# Prerequisites

There are some computer literacy skills unrelated to programming that ideally are learned before the kids get into a classroom.  In my mind, these are things that a parent can teach them at home, and allow them have gentle & unrushed practice a few weeks/months before they see a programming language.

This is an approximate order of difficulty.

1. Send short, silly emails to a grandparent.  This stage's content can be full of typos. Ideally the recipient is using a different computer, and in a different house (or at least a different room).  I like grandparents for this role, because it's more likely to feel like fun, and not a technical lesson.  

    A few dozen of these should help them make the connection that the content they write is somehow processed and moved by a computer.  And that hitting execute/send initiate a chain of automated events.  This seems like an important jump from writing the exact same sentences with pen & paper.  At this stage, hen pecking is fine for typing.
    
    I think IM might be better than email (maybe even embedded in a Skype or Google Hangout session), if the recipient is comfortable with it.  IM's immediacy is better, but I like how they can review previous emails the next time they start the computer.  Maybe a mix of both is best.
    
1. Be comfortable typing, with proper hand positions & mechanics.  We used a free kid-oriented program in Linux (eg, [Tux Typing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tux_Typing)).  I'm sure there are lots of these for each OS.  Ideally it has a phase where it teaches which keys are hit by which fingers, and another game-like phase (eg, the kid has to type a word before it falls to earth).

1. Write longer emails to a grandparent.  These should be mistake-free by the time it's sent.  It doesn't have to be serious, but it should be long enough that they learn to
    * Recognize typos, and correct them.
    * Navigate with a keyboard (not just a mouse/touchpad).  Be comfortable using arrows keys, page up/down, home/end.
    * Select, copy, & paste (both with a mouse selecting and right-clicking, and with the keys selecting and ctrl+c & ctrl+v).
    * Moving, resizing, & closing windows within the operating system.


    I don't know how to prompt the following naturally, but I think it's important.  They should get practice moving around content (eg, rearranging the words within a sentence, or the sentence within a paragraph).  I think this is important for programming because they should be able to quickly rearrange the steps within a sequence of instructions.  If they can do it quickly and instinctively, they'll be able to manipulate the logic, without getting distracted or frustrated by the keyboard mechanics.

1. Practice transcribing a paragraph from a book they like.  Include it in the *body* of an example email.

    ```
    Hi Grammy, I just read this in a funny book:
     
    > When her fever finally subsided weeks later, the paralytic polio had...
    ```

1. Transcribe a paragraph, but this time write it in a simple text editor (eg, Notepad, TextEditor, gedit).  Save the file, and attach it in an email.  I want them to get a feel for a stand-alone file.  And saving.  
    
    One of the times they're transcribing, close the file without saving, and demonstrate the concept of losing work.  Ideally they lose a sentence or two --long enough for them to remember, but not long enough to be cruel.
